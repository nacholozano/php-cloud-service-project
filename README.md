# php-hosting-project

This is a PHP hosting project with learning purpose

Status: developing

2015/02/19: Don't try this code, there are some problems I have to solve. 
Try a demo here: http://mycloud-nacholozano.rhcloud.com/

Installation's notes:

- Configure your server name, database user name, password and database name in 'conf-db.php'
- Configure a route in your server for folder's users in 'conf-app.php'
- Create database running 'modelo/create-db.php'

Known problems:

- Activate JavaScript in your browser. The file size check use JavaScript before uploading any file. I know I also have to do the check in the server-side.

- Problem with breadcrumbs when you migrate the project to other server.

I know possible solutions for this problems. But I don't have time to fix them.
