# php-cloud-service-project

<b>Third school year project</b>

This is a PHP cloud service project with learning purpose with PHP and MySQL in server-side and jQuery and Bootstrap3 in client-side.

I have tried to use MVC. The 'index.php' would be the controller.

### Installation's notes

- Configure your server name, database user name, password and database name in 'conf-db.php'
- Configure a route in your server for users folders and other route for tmp folder in 'conf-app.php'
- Create database running 'modelo/create-db.php'

### Known problems

- Active JavaScript in your browser. The file size check use JavaScript before uploading any file. I know I also have to do the file size check in the server-side.
- Problem with breadcrumbs when you migrate the project to other server.
- The PDF reports don't add the PDF size.

I know possible solutions for this problems. But I don't have time to fix them.
